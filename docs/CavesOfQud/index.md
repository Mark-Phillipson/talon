# Caves of Qud

## Current Status
The game should be perfectly accessible using its keybindings. (saying things like "control space" or "odd left") Some basic actions have corresponding talon phrases which are more intuitive, but that file is a work in progress.

## How to Play
> General instructions about how the game works, and mechanically how to play are beyond the scope of this guide. This is just teaching you how to push the buttons, not when and where to use them.

For this game, a valid direction is both directions such as "northeast" or "south", as well as "left" or "up". When you see `direction`, say the direction that you want.

To walk one tile at a time, say `go direction`

To auto walk in a direction, until you reach the edge of the map or see an enemy, simply say `auto walk direction`. The word auto is optional. 

The default, multifunction interaction command (that does different things depending on context) is `use` or `interact`. You can also specify a direction for those if you want.

To open a chest or door, say `open direction`

todo: the rest of the commands. you should be able to figure it out by reading the talon file though.
