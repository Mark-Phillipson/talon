# Contribution Guide
These aren't hard rules, but might help you understand what I want this project to be.

## Be Newbie Friendly
Whenever possible, aim for the target audience of "people who literally just installed talon, and want to play their favorite games". Don't assume an astronomical amount of tech literacy, and over explaining is better than under explaining. (but with that said, you can keep it concise if that's all you've got the time for. this is a work in progress, and others will build on what you've done)

## Be Nice
Self explanatory.
