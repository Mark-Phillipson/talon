# Talon Stuff

[If you just want to read the guides, click here.](https://mimuki.net/talon/)

This isn't anything much yet, but the hope is that eventually - this will become a useful resource for getting into gaming as a new talon user, regardless of your skill level or tech literacy. 

The main priority right now is getting a list of games known to work well with talon. That's enough information for someone adventurous to start figuring it out, but making actual guides for setting up and playing games is the eventual goal here. But that takes more effort!
